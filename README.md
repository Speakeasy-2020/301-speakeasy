## Change Log

### Day 1 // 2020.02.17

**8:30pm:** We got a late start to discussion around project stuff. Spent 1 hour building out basic rules and guidelines for the group, independent of the actual project.

### Day 2 // 2020.02.18

**6:30pm:** We all met in a conference room to brainstorm ideas. We had several directions to take. Looks like the top contenders are an Adult Beverage App and a Text Analysis App. Took us about an hour to get to those after discussing pros/cons for our other ideas.

**7:45pm:** We have started putting together the skeleton of our project setup tasks. Going through and trying to refine our ideas such that they are formatted correctly to turn in project prep assignments.

**8:35pm:** We successfully pitched the food/drink app to John. He suggested that we reorient it to focus on party/potluck organizing. 

**8:55pm:** We settled on the team name Speakeasy! Setting up repo stuff now.

**9:10pm:** Project prep 1 and 2 are in. #3 being worked now. Now looking at doing #4.

### Day 3 // 2020.02.19

**6:30pm:** We have assembled and the tasks for the day are to get the DOM model and wireframes figured out. If we can get those two things really polished, then that should set us up nicely for the rest of the project. Even better if we actually get to coding. Kory unfortunately talked to his doctor and was told to stay home for another couple days. Hopefully he is feeling better by Saturday. We will loop him into our decision-making and jump on a conference call if he's feeling well enough.
