## Change Log

### Day 1 // 2020.02.17

**8:30pm:** We got a late start to discussion around project stuff. Spent 1 hour building out basic rules and guidelines for the group, independent of the actual project.

### Day 2 // 2020.02.18

**6:30pm:** We all met in a conference room to brainstorm ideas. We had several directions to take. Looks like the top contenders are an Adult Beverage App and a Text Analysis App. Took us about an hour to get to those after discussing pros/cons for our other ideas.

**7:45pm:** We have started putting together the skeleton of our project setup tasks. Going through and trying to refine our ideas such that they are formatted correctly to turn in project prep assignments.

**8:35pm:** We successfully pitched the food/drink app to John. He suggested that we reorient it to focus on party/potluck organizing. 

**8:55pm:** We settled on the team name Speakeasy! Setting up repo stuff now.

**9:10pm:** Project prep 1 and 2 are in. #3 being worked now. Now looking at doing #4.

### Day 3 // 2020.02.19

**6:30pm:** We have assembled and the tasks for the day are to get the DOM model and wireframes figured out. If we can get those two things really polished, then that should set us up nicely for the rest of the project. Even better if we actually get to coding. Kory unfortunately talked to his doctor and was told to stay home for another couple days. Hopefully he is feeling better by Saturday. We will loop him into our decision-making and jump on a conference call if he's feeling well enough.

**8:30pm:** We have iterated heavily on the wireframes and data flows. In this process, we have downsized lots of features in order to make MVP on time. Right now we are trying to figure out the data structure for all the different data objects we will be working with. This is proving to be much more complex than we thought it would be initially. Definitely getting into the weeds on this. We will have to build wireframes and domain model in another session.

**9:00pm:** We spoke to Cory and Leo. They helped us visualize the way we will need to structure the data. We will need to make many different SQL tables. Turns out this will be much more complicated than we thought. Brett and Thomas are trying to get something barebones deployed so we can at least have something living out there. Daniel has added our domain model and wireframes to a basic draw.io template. He will try to get those fleshed out before we meet for tomorrowâ€™s session. Then we can begin proper coding.
