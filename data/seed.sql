-- These seed data queries will be ordered as if the first user were using the page for the first time.

-- The first action will be to add the user. We'll use Ron Dunphy's stage name for this!
INSERT INTO users (userName) VALUES ('Rubiksron');
-- Going forward, we need to hold onto a value here. Probably best to hold onto userName (Rubiksron), as that's completely unique, and that will be set in our app.local variables

-- The next thing they'll do is to create an event. The cocktailList column is NULL for now, this will involve an update query later.
INSERT INTO events (title, eventsOwner, date, location, description) VALUES ('Class party', 'Rubiksron', 1583003647, 'Ada Lovelace Classroom, Codefellows, Seattle, WA', 'What a great class, we should have a celebration for everybody!');
-- Like the userName, we'll need to hold onto the event name in app.local as well.

-- Next, the user will create a list of drinks to add. We'll pull three cocktails from the cocktaildb API, modeled after Kory's constructor function
INSERT INTO drinks (drinkTitle, cocktailID, thumbnail, instructions, glass) VALUES ('Grizzly Bear', 12762, 'https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/media/drink/k6v97f1487602550.jpg', 'Served over ice. Sounds nasty, but tastes great.', 'Collins Glass');

-- This next query adds these drinks to the eventsMenus table, and it needs a few things. We'll need the cocktailID's from all the cocktails that were inserted into table:drinks, and we'll need the userName and events title that we stored in app.local.

-- The next several queries add all the ingredients from the three cocktails to the recipes table. All ingredients in recipes will be unique, they cannot be reused as they have a volume/quantity parameter specific to a cocktailID.

-- Next, the user will build a guest list. We need to call from app.local our eventsID.
